Constraints
===========

The subpackage **Constraints** summarizes variable bound reducing methods in order to decrease the initial search volume. The input system has to be well-determined and (non)linear algebraic. 
Initial bounds for the unkown variables must be specified by the user.

For such systems other research institutes like the mathematical institute from the university of vienna have already introduced interval-reducing methods by the use of interval union and the Gauss-Seidl-operator [SOURCE].

This method builds the origin of the own research activities and is topic of section [REFERENCE]. The own implementation and modifications are explained subsequently in section [REFERENCE]
